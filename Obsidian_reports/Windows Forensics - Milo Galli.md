## Scenario

```
In a jurisdiction where Owls are illegal to trade and buy, two users are discussing the illegal trade of owls. The computer and mobile device taken into evidence are of a user who is attempting to purchase owls illegally. The user has contacted another user who can provide an owl in exchange for cash. An owl is decided upon, and an exchange is scheduled. After the exchange, a communication message is sent confirming the owl purchase has been completed.
```

The target's name is Sarah McAvoy and looking at the image with different tools it appears that her activity was condensed in a time-span from **1/27/2017** to **2/2/2017**
## 1 / 27 / 2017

The target downloaded and set up Chrome at 00:54:30 and Skype right after.
Right after installing Chrome the target surfed the web looking at different topics all related to mythical beasts and harry potter, especially owls.

She then opened a pdf file called **"Great Horned Owl Info.pdf"** at 16:16
At 18:19 she downloaded and accessed two jpg files:
- **"Snowy Owl.jpg"** 
- **"Pigmy Owl.jpg"**

	After that in a time span that goes from 18:59:39 PM to 19:06 PM the target visited a website that sold owls from the UK ( www.birdtrader.co.uk) and other sites about owls.

The sites visited included: 
- www.reference.com/pets-animals" -> 
	- What do snowy owls eat?
	- What animals are predators of the snowy owl?
	- What do great horned owls eat?
	- Where to keep a snowy owl?
	- Are owls endangered?
- www.quora.com -> 
	- how much does an owl cost?
	- How to own an owl?
- google searches -> 
	- where to keep an owl
	- how to care for an owl 
- www.internationalowlcenter.org ->
	- Owls as pets
- www.exoticpets.about.com -> 
	- What should you know about having an owl for a pet
- www.abcbirds.com ->
	- Northern Spotted owl continues to decline
- **barnowltrust.org.uk** ->
	- Thinking of keeping a captive Barn Owl?

The target visited again the site "www.birdtrader.co.uk" at 18:31 PM looking at different owls' breeds and visited also "www.amazon.com" for 10 additional minutes.
Then she deleted some images that she had previously downloaded, not emptying the bin.

At 18:33 we have a major spike in our analysis since the target visited a gmail url with title **"Owls for sale"** and at the same hour she downloaded and accessed some photos with the following names: 
- **"Snowy Owl2.jpg"** -> 18:33:22
- **"Snowy Owl3.jpg"**-> 18:33:24
- **"Snowy Owl4.jpg"** -> 18:33:24

Considering that we can assume that the target contacted someone met online after visiting the previously cited websites and contacted him/her via email in order to purchase an owl.
## 1 / 28 /2017

This hypothesis finds another traction point because at  22:46 PM the target went online on **www.youtube.com** and searched for "How to take care of owls", then looking at videos:
- "Owls to you, How it all started"
- "What to do if you want to pet an owl"

The target then in a time span that goes from 23:28 PM to 23:23 logged on yahoo-messanger and tumblr.
On tumblr she looked at different content regarding owls ( https://itsdrhoo.tumblr.com/)
After that she looked on www.etsy.com at 23:40 PM the keyword "owl".

During the whole browsing she visited multiple times www.gmail.com with the following account
- mcavoys87@gmail.com

The target looked on the web for snowy owls and saved photos on the pc but she then deleted all of the owl pictures.

The hyphotesis here is that she received a offer for the purchase of a snowy owl and she considered it while browising on other online shops looking for the same animal, but finally accapting the offer and deleting other possible purchases.
## 1 /  31 / 2017

The target downloaded some pdf files about owl's care and accessed them at 20:10 :
- **"Owl_Emergency_Care.pdf"**
- **"Owl_Keeping.pdf"**
- **"Snowy Owl.pdf"**

After that she searched on **www.youtube.com** at 20:21 looking for these topics:
- Owls' wingspan
- Snowy Owls' wingspan

As well as a xls files about Snowy owls:
- **"Bibliography - Snowy Owl 14 April 2014- GLOW posting.xls"** -> 7:12:44 PM

The target also accessed a pdf file named **Snowy_Owl.pdf** located in the Desktop folder at 19:12:19.

The target used Skype at 19:26:31 and during  the usage of the application she chatted with some friends about topics that didn't involve owls.

## 2 / 1 / 2017 

The target downloaded, set up and accessed Pidgin, which is a multi-platform app for instant messaging, at 17:59 looking also at the the about page of the software in the following minutes.

Looking at the **C:/Users/Sarah\ M/AppData/Roaming/.purple** configuration folder we can say that she registered a Gmail and a Facebook account using for both the email address **"mcavoys87@gmail.com"**.

The hypothesis is that she downloaded this application in order to chat with the bird trader she had previously contatcted via another email platform, Gmail.
