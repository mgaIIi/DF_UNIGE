## Scenario

```
In a jurisdiction where Owls are illegal to trade and buy, two users are discussing the illegal trade of owls. The computer and mobile device taken into evidence are of a user who is attempting to purchase owls illegally. The user has contacted another user who can provide an owl in exchange for cash. An owl is decided upon, and an exchange is scheduled. After the exchange, a communication message is sent confirming the owl purchase has been completed.
