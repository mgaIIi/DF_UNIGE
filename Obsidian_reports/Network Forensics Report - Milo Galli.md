# Network Forensic Analysis

## Assignment

```
The Potenzio company requests that you analyze the attached PCAP file and 
create a written report (suggested length: 2 pages) detailing whether any 
malicious activities occurred and providing a timeline of the related events.

Please organize the report using the 5W1H method (Who, What, Where, When,
Why, How) and specify the timestamp and hashes of related artifacts for 
each event.

Note the following hints:
    The IP address 203.0.113.2 is used by Potenzio as a masquerade address.
    The IP address 203.0.113.113 is the providerâ€™s DNS address.

Both of the above addresses can be considered trusted.
Please ignore Layer 2 information.
