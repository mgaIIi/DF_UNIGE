Prepare a PDF report by analyzing the provided disk images and answering the associated questions.

Describe how you analyzed/resolved the situation and justify your answers for each one. List the tools/commands you used and how. Include screenshots if they can help clarify/support your findings.

Use different tools and compare their results whenever possible, commenting on discrepancies.

Before starting, verify the SHA256 hashes of the uncompressed images and contact us if they do not correspond to the ".sha256" files (you can use "sha256sum --check *.sha256" to check the three hashes).

All images are in RAW/dd format (and distributed compressed by xz).

Something fishy is going on. Someone gave us this image of an unpartitioned FAT filesystem containing a JPEG picture. However, this volume seems to have just been (re)formatted to hide something.

Can you reconstruct the original partition scheme and recover the content of the original partition?

Is the image partitioned/bootable? If partitioned, list all partitions.

Inside, you'll find a FAT FS:
- what is the volume label?
- what is the sector size?
- what is the cluster size?
- how many FAT tables are present?
- are there sectors that are unused by the FS? If yes, what do they contain?

How many files/deleted-files with extension TXT are there?
Can you read them by readonly-mounting them/by using TSK? Why?

One of them should correspond to SHA256

... which one?

If you cannot extract such content, something is corrupted (hint hint); find the root cause and fix the file system before continuing.
You must explain how you found and fixed the problem.

Inside the file corrupted.dd there are some occurrences of the string "zxgio" (without quotes); can you list their offset in bytes?

For each occurrence of such a string, determine its location with respect to the FAT file system. For instance, is the string contained inside a file? Is it in some unused/slack space? In other areas?

What partition scheme has been used for this image?
Can you identify the file system type for each partition and extract the files that are contained?

What is so strange about this image?
